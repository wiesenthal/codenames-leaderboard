~~~ Codenames rules
SETUP
Players split up into two teams of similar
size and skill. You need at least four
players (two teams of two) for a standard
game. Variants for two or three players
can be found on the back page.
Each team chooses one player to be
their spymaster. Both spymasters sit on
the same side of the table. The other
players sit across from their spymasters.
They are field operatives.
Randomly choose 25 codenames and
place them on the table in a 5-by-5 grid.
Note: While shuffling the codename
cards, be sure to flip over half the deck
once in a while. This will mix the words
more thoroughly.

THE KEY
Each game has one key that reveals the secret identities of the cards on the table. The spymasters
should choose the key card randomly and slide it into the stand between them. Any side can be up.
Don't think about it. Just slide it into the stand. And don't let the field operatives see it.
 The key corresponds to the grid on the table. Blue squares correspond to words that Blue Team must
guess (blue agents). Red squares correspond to words that Red Team must guess (red agents). Pale
squares are innocent bystanders, and the black square is an assassin who should never be contacted at all!

STARTING TEAM
The four lights around the edge of the key card indicate which team starts. The starting
team has 9 words to guess. The other team has 8. The starting team will give the first clue
of the game.
AGENT CARDS
8 red agents 8 blue agents
The red agent cards go in a stack in
front of the red spymaster. The blue
agent cards should be in front of the
blue spymaster. This helps everyone
remember which team they are on.
1 double agent
The double agent belongs to whichever
team starts. Flip it to that team's color.
It will be one of that team's agent cards
for the duration of the game.
7 innocent
bystanders 1 assassin
The innocent bystander cards and the
assassin should be kept in between,
where both spymasters can reach them
easily.
GAME OVERVIEW
Spymasters know the secret identities of 25 agents. Their teammates know the agents only by their
codenames.
Spymasters take turns giving one-word clues. A clue may relate to multiple words on the table. The field
operatives try to guess which words their spymaster meant. When a field operative touches a word, the
spymaster reveals its secret identity. If the field operatives guess correctly, they may continue guessing,
until they run out of ideas for the given clue or until they hit a wrong person. Then it is the other team's
turn to give a clue and guess. The first team to contact all their agents wins the game.

GAME PLAY
Teams take turns. The starting team is indicated by the 4 lights on the edges of the key card.
GIVING A CLUE
If you are the spymaster, you are trying to think of a one-word clue that relates to some of the words
your team is trying to guess. When you think you have a good clue, you say it. You also say one
number, which tells your teammates how many codenames are related to your clue.
Example: Two of your words are NUT and BARK. Both of these grow on trees, so you say tree: 2 .
You are allowed to give a clue for only one word (cashew: 1 ) but it's fun to try for two or more. Getting
four words with one clue is a big accomplishment.
One Word
Your clue must be only one word. You are not allowed to give extra hints. For example, don't say,
"This may be a bit of a stretch…" You are playing Codenames. It's always a bit of a stretch.
Your clue cannot be any of the codenames visible on the table. On later turns, some codenames will
be covered up, so a clue that is not legal now might be legal later.
MAKING CONTACT
When the spymaster gives a clue, his or her field operatives try to figure out what it means. They can
debate it amongst themselves, but the spymaster must keep a straight face. The operatives indicate
their official guess when one of them touches one of the codenames on the table.
• If the field operative touches a card belonging to his or her team, the spymaster covers the word
with an agent card in that color. The operatives get another guess (but not another clue).
• If the field operative touches an innocent bystander, the spymaster covers it with an innocent
bystander card. This ends the turn.
• If the field operative touches a card belonging to the other team, the word is covered by one of
the other team's agent cards. This ends the turn. (And it helps the other team.)
• If the field operative touches the assassin, the word is covered by the assassin card. This ends the
game! The team that contacted the assassin loses.
Tip: Before saying your clue out loud, make sure it doesn't relate to the assassin.
Number of Guesses
The field operatives must always make at least one guess. Any wrong guess ends the turn
immediately, but if the field operatives guess a word of their team's color, they can keep guessing.
You can stop guessing at any time, but usually you want to guess as many words as the spymaster
said. Sometimes you might even want to guess one more:
Example: Red Team's first clue was tree: 2 . The red operative wanted to guess ORANGE and NUT.
She guessed ORANGE first. That was an innocent bystander, so she did not get a chance to guess NUT.
Blue Team took a turn and correctly guessed two words. Now it is Red Team's turn again.
The red spymaster says river: 3 . The red operative is pretty sure the AMAZON is a river, so she touches
that card. The spymaster covers it with a red agent card, so she gets to go again. A river has a BED,
so she touches that codename. It's also red, so she can go again.
4
She's not sure of the third river word. She picks
NUT. This has nothing to do with river . She is
guessing a word from the previous clue.
NUT is a red word. The operative has made
3 correct guesses for the clue river: 3 . She is
allowed one final guess. She can try to find the
third river word, or she can try to find the other
tree word. Or she can stop at three and let Blue
Team have a turn.
You are allowed only one extra guess. In the
example above, the red operative would be
allowed 4 guesses because her spymaster said
the number 3 . When the field operatives say
they are done guessing (or when they guess
wrong) it is the other team's turn.
GAME FLOW
PENALTY FOR INVALID CLUES
If a spymaster gives an invalid clue, the
team's turn ends immediately. As an additional
penalty, the other team's spymaster may cover
one of his or her words with an agent card
before giving the next clue.
But if no one notices that a clue is invalid, it
counts as valid.
Spymasters take turns giving clues. After
a spymaster gives a clue, his or her team starts
guessing. Their turn ends when they guess
wrong, when they decide to stop, or when they
have made the maximum number of guesses
for that clue. Then it is the other team's turn.
ENDING THE GAME
KEEPING A STRAIGHT FACE
The spymaster is expected to keep a straight
face. Do not reach for any card while your
teammates are considering the words. When
a teammate touches a word, consult the key
card and cover the word with the card of
the corresponding color. When a teammate
chooses a word of the correct color, you
should act as though it was exactly the word
you meant, even if it wasn't.
If you are a field operative, you should focus
on the table when you are making your
guesses. Do not make eye contact with the
spymaster while you are guessing. This will
help you avoid nonverbal cues.
When your information is strictly limited to
what can be conveyed with one word and one
number, you are playing in the spirit of the game.
The game ends when one team has all their
words covered. That team wins.
It is possible to win on the other team's turn if
they guess your last word.
The game can end early if a field operative
makes contact with the assassin. That
operative's team loses.
Setup for the Next Game
Do other people want a chance to be
spymasters? Setup for the second game
is easy. Remove the cards covering the
codenames and put them back in their stacks.
Now just flip over the 25 codenames, and
you're ready to go!
WHAT'S THE TIMER FOR?
Sorry. We almost forgot. You see, we don't
use the sand timer very often.
If a player is thinking too long, any player can
flip the sand timer and ask the slow player to
make a decision before time runs out.
If you are having trouble, you can even use
the sand timer on yourself. If you can't find
a good clue before time runs out, just give
a clue for your hardest word and keep thinking
while the other team plays.

limits, you can download our timer app at

VALID CLUES
We playtested various rules. Some groups like the rules one way. Some like the rules another way.
You should experiment to find out what your group likes.
FIRM RULES
Some clues are invalid because they violate the
spirit of the game.
Your clue must be about the meaning of the
words. You can't use your clue to talk about
the letters in a word or its position on the table.
Gland is not a valid clue for ENGLAND. You
can't tie BUG, BED, and BOW together with
a clue like b: 3 nor with a clue like three: 3 .
However …
Letters and numbers are valid clues, as long
as they refer to meanings. You can use X: 1 as
a clue for RAY. You can use eight: 3 as a clue
for BALL, FIGURE, and OCTOPUS.
The number you say after your clue can't be
used as a clue. Citrus: 8 is not a valid clue for
LEMON and OCTOPUS.
You must play in English. A foreign word is
allowed only if the players in your group would
use it in an English sentence. For example,
you can't use Apfel as a clue for APPLE and
BERLIN, but you can use strudel .
You can't say any form of a visible word
on the table. Until BREAK is covered up by
a card, you can't say break , broken , breakage ,
or breakdown .
You can't say part of a compound word on the
table. Until HORSESHOE is covered up, you
can't say horse , shoe , unhorsed , or snowshoe .
HOMONYMS & SPELLING
English has a lot of homonyms. For example,
night sounds like knight , but these two words
don't mean the same thing.
Same-sounding words with different
meanings and different spellings are
considered different words. So you can't give
knight -related clues for NIGHT.
Words that are spelled the same are
considered the same even though they might
have different pronunciations and meanings.
For example, actors take a bow and the bow is
part of a ship, so you could use bow as a clue
for THEATER and SHIP. You could also use it as
a clue for archery-related things, even though
that bow is pronounced differently.
You are allowed to spell out your clue. For
example, if you want your teammates to guess
THEATER and STRING, you can spell out b-o-w
without committing to a pronunciation. You can
give the clue k-n-i-g-h-t even when NIGHT is
one of the codenames on the table. (But you
can't use t-h-e-a-t-r-e when THEATER is on
the table. Theatre and theater are different
forms of the same word.)
You should spell out your clue if someone
asks. If you aren't that strong on spelling, ask
the opposing spymaster for help.
Tip: Spelling is not just for homonyms. It's also
useful when the room is noisy or when the
players have very different accents.
DON'T BE TOO STRICT
England and island were originally compound words, but in this century, island is a valid clue for
ENGLAND. Even land is a valid clue for ENGLAND. And anybody who says you can't say sparrow when
ROW is on the table is just trying to cause trouble.
If the opposing spymaster allows it, the clue is valid. If you aren't sure, ask your opponent. (Quietly,
so the others can't hear.)

FLEXIBLE RULES
Sometimes you have to make judgment calls
about what is valid and what is not. Different
groups may prefer to play the game differently.
Compound Words
English has three ways to write a compound
word. Greenhouse is one word. Pack rat is two
words. Mother-in-law is hyphenated. Technically,
only greenhouse can be a one-word clue.
You can decide to allow any compound words.
However, in no case should a player be allowed
to invent compound words. Lunar squid is not
a valid clue for MOON and OCTOPUS.
Proper Names
Proper names are always valid clues if they
follow the other rules. George is a valid clue, but
you might want to specify whether you mean
George Washington or George W. Bush . Your
group can agree to count proper names as one
word. This would also allow titles such as The
Three Musketeers . Even if you don't allow multi-
word proper names, you might want to make an
exception for place names like New York .
Spymasters should not be allowed to make up
names, not even names that turn out to be
real. Sue Mee is not a valid clue for CHINA and
LAWYER.
Acronyms and Abbreviations
Technically, CIA is not one word. But it is
a great clue. You can decide to allow common
abbreviations like UK , lol , and PhD . And words
like laser , radar , and sonar are always allowed,
even though they originated as acronyms.
Homonyms
Some people prefer to allow a more liberal use
of homonyms. You can allow knight to be a clue
for night -related things if that makes the game
more fun for you.
Rhymes
Rhymes are always valid when they refer to
meanings. Snail is a valid clue for MAIL because
this rhyme is a common phrase. Snail is also
a valid clue for WHALE because they are both
animals. Snail is not a valid clue for SCALE
because their main association is through the
sound of the words. (If someone in your group
has a job weighing snails, however, this clue is
perfectly fine.)
Some people like to allow any kind of rhyming
clue. If you decide to allow this, just remember
that you aren't allowed to indicate you are giving
a rhyming clue. Your operatives will have to
figure that out for themselves.
EXPERT CLUE: ZERO
You are allowed to use 0 as the number part
of your clue. For example, feathers: 0 means,
"None of our words relate to feathers ."
If 0 is the number, the usual limit on guesses
does not apply. Field operatives can guess
as many words as they want. They still must
guess at least one word.
If you're not sure why this is useful, don't
worry. You'll figure it out.
EXPERT CLUE: UNLIMITED
Sometimes you may have multiple unguessed
words related to clues from the previous
rounds. If you want your team to guess more
than one of them, you may say unlimited
instead of a number. For example feathers:
unlimited .
The disadvantage is that the field operatives
do not know how many words are related to
the new clue. The advantage is that they may
guess as many words as they want.

TWO-PLAYER GAME
If there are only two of you, you can play on the same team. This two-player variant also works for
larger groups of people who don't feel like competing against each other. You will try to get a high
score against a simulated opponent.
Set up the game as usual. One player will be the spymaster and the rest will be field operatives.
The other team has no players, but you still need their stack of agent cards.
Your team should go first, so be sure to pick a key

many agent cards are still left in the enemy's stack.
Note: Your score will be determined by how many turns you needed and also by how many enemy
agents you contacted accidentally.
THREE-PLAYER GAME
Three players who want to be on the same team can play as described above. If two players want
to compete against each other, they can be spymasters and the third player can be their operative.
Setup and game play are as usual, except that the single field operative is working for both sides.
(Just like spies in real life!) The winning spymaster is determined in the usual way. The field operative
tries to do a good job for both sides.
